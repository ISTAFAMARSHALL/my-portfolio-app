                    {/* <h2>My Journey</h2> */}
                    {/* <p>I had a love for technology from a young age. I always found myself assisting others in setting up or fixing electronic devices, especially my grandfather. Any new shiny thing he would bring home there I was setting it up for him.</p>
                    <p>I was introduced to programming in my senior year of high school. Ultimately this love for technology drove me into the Navy as a Cryptological Technician Technical CTT, specializing in anti-missile defense.</p>
                    <p>Realizing anti-missile defense would never lead to civilian life and knowing I wanted a career in the tech field, I achieved my CCNA Certified Cisco Networking Administrator.</p>
                    <p>During this time being offered territory manager of a prestigious Commercial Kitchen Repair company was something I could not turn down. I led a team of 12 technicians averaging a GOP exceeding 40% for three years.</p>
                    <p>However, with all my success and achievements, I felt unfulfilled. In pursuit of true self-fulfillment and happiness, I resigned and registered for Flat Iron School for software engineering.</p>
                    <p>Over the following 60 weeks, I mastered Javascript, React, HTML, and Ruby. I was able to hone my skills in front-end and back-end development. The learning curve was steep yet exhilarating knowing how rewarding the outcome would be upon completion.</p>
                    <p>Several apps later, I started Code By Istafa, LLC as a freelance venture aimed at cultivating 15-plus years of customer service management along with military precision, and planning to build world-changing applications.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to inspire through creativity, designing innovative engaging ways for users to interact with apps.</p> */}

                    From a young age, I was captivated by technology. Whether it was setting up my grandfather's new gadgets or fixing electronic devices for friends and family, I was always the go-to tech enthusiast.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In my senior year of high school, I discovered programming, a revelation that sparked a deeper passion for technology. This passion led me to join the Navy as a Cryptologic Technician Technical (CTT), specializing in anti-missile defense systems. Although this role was deeply rewarding, I realized that my future lay in the broader tech industry.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    To transition into civilian tech roles, I earned my CCNA certification as a Cisco Certified Network Administrator. Soon after, I was offered the position of Territory Manager at a prestigious Commercial Kitchen Repair company. Leading a team of 12 technicians, I consistently achieved a GOP exceeding 40% for three years. Despite my success, I felt a persistent lack of fulfillment.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Determined to find true satisfaction, I left my managerial role and enrolled in Flatiron School's software engineering program. Over 60 intensive weeks, I mastered JavaScript, React, HTML, and Ruby, gaining expertise in both front-end and back-end development. The steep learning curve was both challenging and exhilarating, but the rewards were undeniable.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    With newfound skills and a relentless drive, I founded Code By Istafa, LLC. As a freelancer, I combine over 15 years of customer service management experience with military precision and strategic planning to create world-changing applications.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    My mission is to inspire through creativity, designing innovative and engaging ways for users to interact with technology. I am excited to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to a dynamic team, driving innovation and excellence in every project.
